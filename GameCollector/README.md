## Mobile App 

###  Overall Description 
Creating mobile App for both platforms Android and iOS using technology of Xamarin.Forms. 
I am using C# and xaml to create backend and front-end. 

### Mechanics  
Starting from LogIn page to get access to our account (in the cloud). If we don't have an account, there is always clickable button to register. 
Going forward, we have TabbedPage splitted on three Pages:
- Playing - Now
- Wanna Play - In the future
- Finished. 
To make them full, need to use Search Button and find our title, then choose button with name of these three pages to ascribe to them. The game is showing as a cover - Image.
Every game in the lists have their details like: -Relase Date, -Developer, - Our Rate and etc.
